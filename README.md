A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook to run [ktfmt](https://github.com/facebookincubator/ktfmt).

## Requirements

This commit hook requires Python `>=3.8`.

`ktfmt` requires Java 11. The `java` in your `PATH` must be version `>=11`.

## Usage Instructions

Add the following lines to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/davehadley/ktfmt-pre-commit-hook
  rev: 0.8.0
  hooks:
  - id: ktfmt
    stages: [commit]
```

To specify a specific version of `ktfmt` pass `--version=XX.YY.ZZ` with the `args` option. 
All other `args` provided will be passed onto `ktfmt`. For example:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/davehadley/ktfmt-pre-commit-hook
  rev: 0.8.0
  hooks:
  - id: ktfmt
    args: [--version=0.53, --dropbox-style]
    stages: [commit]
```

See the [ktfmt documentation](https://facebookincubator.github.io/ktfmt/) for supported command line arguments.

Please report any bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/davehadley/ktfmt-pre-commit-hook/issues).
